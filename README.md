Hi! This is Omar, I made this quick game for you to enjoy /  mess around with as you like. 

There are some stuff I wanna get out of the way here since I might have not explicitly explained them in the actual file... oops.

1- In the easy difficulty, you get 7 lives and your range of numbers to guess is 0 to 10.
2- In the medium difficulty, you get 10 lives and your range of numbers to guess is 0 to 50.
3- In the hard difficulty, you get 5 lives and your range of numbers to guess is 0 to 100.
4- In the impossible difficulty, you get 1 life and your range of numbers to guess is 0 to 100.

That is all. Thank you for reading this :)
